# User Authorization
### Asking Permission

Now that we have the application all set up, we can proceed to get authorization from the user to allow our app to connect to their
Spotify account. First we need to make a page that asks the user permission access their user data from Spotify. For brevity we will 
omit the HTML code, but examples can be found at https://developer.spotify.com.
